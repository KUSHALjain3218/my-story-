THE STORY OF A MONKEY WITH HIS PARTNER

The monkey was like a bad blood for his owner. The monkey actually worked for his owner in the field but one day when the owner decided to calculate that how much money he spend on his monkey and how much did he earned from his work he saw that there was a considerable differance as owning a monkey used to costy him a lot more than what he earned. So, he kicked him out.
